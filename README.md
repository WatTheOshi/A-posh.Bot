# 🤖 What is "A posh"?

**Note:** *Currently available only in Russian, but still intuitive and easy to use!*

> "A posh" is a Discord bot with a standard set of utility and moderation commands — plus some unique and fun features.

## 🚀 How does it work?

"A posh" is written in Python using several helpful libraries.  
The stable version is hosted 24/7 on my smartphone (a surprisingly reliable free server) with an average ping of ~150ms.  
The bot’s original Discord token is stored **only on this device**.
